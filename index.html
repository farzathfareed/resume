                       who started or functioning their businesses with debts. Some people suffer from mental depression and some suicide. 
                       Some people do wrong things to pay back their debts. The current financial or banking system in this world has stuck 
                       people into a circle and created a dream world for them. My opinion is, this mindset has to be changed </p>
